---------
-If this app was not going to be responsible for actual management of User, Provider and AdSize entities then I 
would probably ditch the JPA entities and just go with a JDBCTemplate for querying.
-I would use a datastore like Couchbase for the distributed caching of the history data across multiple service instances.
Or possibly look at streaming the events to a Kafka queue for async processing and storage.
-I would add autogenerated Swagger API documentation to this service using SpringFox.

Questions:
----------
-How could a user commit fraud with the current design?
The click endpoint could be possibly be invoked multiple times from the same user by reloading the page.

-What might you do to mitigate it?
Keep track of the IP address and user agent of the click request and limit it by a max count or count per time period for a given ad request.
